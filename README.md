# A-Meal-Zing

A-Meal-Zing is an app to help busy, health-conscious go-getters plan their daily home-cooked meals by providing a library of recipes, along with caloric count, which can be easily added to a user's calendar.

Users will be shown a library of recommended recipes and may add selected recipes to a 'favourites list' for easy referencing, or add those they dislike to a 'black list' to remove them from the library. Both actions are reversible. 

App is deployed on: [gh-pages]

Database is deployed on: https://team5-backend.herokuapp.com/


### Approach Taken

Under a very calm and composed leadership, the team of six was divided into a front-end and a back-end team. The main objective of the week was to achieve the MVP of creating a meal planner page that populates a library of recipes from the API and that allows user to add their selection to a selected meal in a selected day. Users will also be able to create multiple meals for each day, and view individual recipe pages for ingredients list, cooking instructions and calorie count.


### Technologies Used

**APIs**
- [Food2Fork](http://food2fork.com/) (recipes library)

**JS Plugins**
- [Sly](http://darsa.in/sly/) (advanced one-directional scrolling)
- [Moment](http://momentjs.com/) (displaying, parsing & manipulating dates)


### Unsolved Problems

- unable to manipulate list of ingredients to explore futher features, such as grocery list, due to API limitations
- back-end server crashes when invalid ajax call is sent
- currently recipe instructions are hard-coded as API only provides link to third-party websites for cooking instructions
