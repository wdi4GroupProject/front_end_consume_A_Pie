# Fork This

Fork This is an app to help busy, health-conscious go-getters plan their daily home-cooked meals by providing a library of recipes, along with caloric count, which can be easily added to a user's calendar.

Users will be shown a library of recommended recipes and may add selected recipes to a 'favourites list' for easy referencing, or add those they dislike to a 'black list' to remove them from the library. Both actions are reversible. 

App is deployed on: [gh-pages]

Database is deployed on: https://team5-backend.herokuapp.com/

The app is developed as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive (WDI) programme.


### Approach Taken

Under a very calm and composed leadership, the team of six was divided into a front-end and a back-end team. 


### Technologies Used

APIs
- Food2Fork (recipes library)

JS Plugins
- Sly (advanced one-directional scrolling)
- Momemt (displaying, parsing & manipulating dates)


### Unsolved Problems

- unable to manipulate list of ingredients to explore futher features, such as grocery list, due to API limitations
- back-end server crashes when invalid ajax call is sent
- currently recipe instructions are hard-coded as API only provides link to third-party websites for cooking instructions
