### Approach Taken




### Tech Used

External APIs
- Food2Fork (recipes library)

JS Plugins
- Sly (advanced one-directional scrolling)
- Momemt (displaying, parsing & manipulating dates)


### Unsolved Problems

- unable to manipulate list of ingredients to explore futher features, such as grocery list, due to API limitations
- back-end server crashes when invalid ajax call is sent
- currently recipe instructions are hard-coded as API only provides link to third-party websites for cooking instructions
